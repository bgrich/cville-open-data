This notebook contains notes from the Open Data workshop and some tutorial 
information on the tools used during it.

## Packages

For the workshop, I will likely need to make use of the following packages. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(jsonlite)
```

## Testing ggmap

I want to create a test image of Charlottesville to play with during the 
workshop. Following the tutorial from the ggmap documentation, I can 
get the following from Google Maps.

### Downloading the map

First, I want to download the map.

```{r, message = FALSE}
cville_map <- get_googlemap("charlottesville virginia", zoom = 12, maptype = "roadmap")
```

### Creating the map

Next, I create the map using ggmap(). 

```{r, fig.width = 13}
ggmap(cville_map)
```
